* Identify fake news and the Reliability index of news agencies
“Fake news represents a threat to democracy if people are deliberately using it on social media platforms to spread misinformation around an election” - Damian Collins, a British lawmaker.
To identify fake or suspicious news, it is important to know the sources cited in the news article.
The best way to check the reliability is to identify if that information is also present in at least one reputable media: the main newspapers (the broadsheet ones) or news agencies.
This is a basic criterion in journalism: cross-check information using reliable sources !!!
You can also compare metrics on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media.

There is no doubt that journalists and politicians depend on each other in a mutual, close, and sometimes uneasy relationship.
Bias by omission – leaving one side out of an article, or a series of articles over a period of time;
Bias by selection of sources – including more sources that support one view over another.
Bias by story selection – a pattern of highlighting news stories that coincide with the agenda of either the Left or the Right, while ignoring stories that coincide with the opposing view
Bias by placement Bias by placement is where on a website (or newspaper) or in an article a story or event is printed; a pattern of placing news stories so as to downplay information supportive of either conservative views or liberal views.
Bias by labeling
Bias by spin – Bias by spin occurs when the story has only one interpretation of an event or policy, to the exclusion of the other

What are the sentiments of people about a particular news -> How to get them?
Categorisation is achieved by (often user-defined) Boolean search word expressions or by using lists of search words with varying (positive or negative) weights and a threshold.
We have seen that there is a need to clearly define, what the source and the target of the sentiment are, subsequently separate the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target.
